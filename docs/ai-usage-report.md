# AI Usage Report

## Tools Used & Use Cases

### 1. **Google DeepMind Agent (Antigravity)**
-   **Code Generation**: Used to generate the initial HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic.
    -   *Example*: Generating the responsive flexbox/grid layout and the dark mode toggle logic.
-   **Project Structure**: Assisted in defining the folder structure and creating necessary files (`.gitignore`, `README.md`).
-   **Documentation**: Helped write the technical documentation and this usage report.

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
-   **Speed**: AI significantly accelerated the development process by generating boilerplate code and standard layout patterns.
-   **Best Practices**: The AI suggested using semantic HTML and CSS variables, which are modern best practices.
-   **Debugging**: Helped ensure the code was error-free from the start (e.g., correct syntax for media queries).

### Challenges
-   **Context**: Sometimes specific design preferences need executed clearly in prompts to get the desired aesthetic.
-   **Customization**: AI-generated code often requires manual tweaking to perfectly match a personal vision or specific assignment constraints.

## Learning Outcomes

-   **CSS Variables**: I learned how efficient it is to use CSS variables for theming (Dark/Light mode) as suggested by the AI.
-   **Semantic HTML**: I reinforced my understanding of semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility.
-   **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: I saw practical examples of selecting elements and modifying their attributes (e.g., `setAttribute` for themes).

## Responsible Use & Modifications

All AI-generated code was reviewed to ensure it met the assignment requirements.
-   I verified that the code is clean and readable.
-   I ensured that the "Contact" form prevents default submission since no backend is required.
-   I checked the responsiveness on different screen sizes to confirm the AI's layout suggestions worked as intended.
